        <h1>Korean noodles</h1>

            (dangmyeon) tossed with various vegetables and meat in a savory-sweet soy-based sauce.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Marinate Beef:</strong> Mix sliced beef with 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp sesame oil, 
                and 1 clove of minced garlic. Let it sit for at least 10–20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare Spinach:</strong> Blanch spinach in boiling water for 30–60 seconds until wilted. 
                Immediately shock in cold water, squeeze out all excess moisture, and toss with
                a pinch of salt and a drizzle of sesame oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook Noodles:</strong> Boil the sweet potato noodles for 6–8 minutes until soft but chewy. 
                Drain and rinse under cold water. Use kitchen shears to cut them into 6-7 inch lengths so 
                they are easier to eat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stir-Fry Vegetables:</strong> Heat oil in a large skillet. Stir-fry the onions, carrots, 
                bell peppers, and mushrooms separately (or in batches) until tender-crisp. This ensures 
                each vegetable retains its distinct color and texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook Beef:</strong> In the same pan, stir-fry the marinated beef over medium-high heat until fully 
                cooked and moisture has evaporated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Combine & Season:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked noodles, 
                sautéed vegetables, spinach, and beef. Pour in the remaining sauce ingredients (soy sauce, sugar, 
                sesame oil, and garlic).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Final Toss:</strong> Traditionally, japchae is tossed by hand (using a glove) to ensure the 
                sauce evenly coats the noodles and vegetables without breaking them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Garnish:</strong> Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and sliced egg ribbons if desired. 
            </li>
        </ol>
