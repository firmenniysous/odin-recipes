    <h1>Lo Mein Noodles: Chinese Noodles</h1>
    <img src="../images/china-lomein.jpg" alt="lo mein chinese noodles" height="250">
    
    <p>Lo mein is a classic Chinese stir-fried noodle dish known for its soft, 
        chewy egg noodles and savory soy-based sauce. Unlike chow mein, which features 
        crispy fried noodles, lo mein noodles are boiled until tender and then tossed with 
        vegetables and protein at the very end of cooking.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Essential ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Noodles: 8–10 oz fresh or dried lo mein egg noodles (spaghetti or linguine can be 
            used as a substitute).
        </li>
        
        <li>Protein (Optional): 1/2 lb of chicken breast, beef flank steak, shrimp, or pork, 
            thinly sliced.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Vegetables: 2–3 cups of a mix such as shredded cabbage, julienned carrots, 
            bell peppers, snow peas, and mushrooms.
        </li>

        <li>
            Aromatics: 2–3 cloves minced garlic, 1 tsp grated fresh ginger, and 2 sliced 
            green onions. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce (for saltiness)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce (for rich color)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce (optional, for depth)</li>
        <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar (to balance the salt)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cornstarch (optional, for a glossy coating)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Noodles:</strong> Boil noodles according to package instructions until just al dente. 
            Drain and rinse with cold water immediately to stop cooking and prevent sticking.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Sauté Aromatics & Protein:</strong> Heat 1–2 tbsp of neutral oil in a wok or 
            large skillet over high heat. Sauté garlic and ginger until fragrant 
            (about 30 seconds). If using meat, add it now and stir-fry until cooked through, 
            then remove and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Stir-Fry Vegetables:</strong> Add more oil if needed. Stir-fry hardy vegetables 
            (carrots, peppers) for 2–3 minutes, then add softer greens (cabbage, spinach) 
            for 1 minute until slightly wilted.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Combine:</strong> Return the cooked protein and noodles to the pan. Pour the sauce over everything.
        </li>

        <li>
           <strong>Toss and Finish:</strong> Use tongs to toss everything together over high heat for 1–2 minutes until 
            he noodles are evenly coated and heated through. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds before serving. 
        </li>
    </ol>
